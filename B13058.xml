            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee, hauing taken into Our Consideration, That the ordering of</hi> the Coyne and values of Coyne within this Realme pertaineth to Vs as a part of Our Regalty; And the making and allowing of Weights and Counterpoizes of Our Money, whereby discouery shall be made of the iustnesse thereof is proper to Vs: And although Wee haue taken order, that Our Money, both Gold and Siluer, should bee of pure mettall, of iust Weight, and Finenesse, so as Wee nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but that in Passing, Change, and Rechange therof euery one in the money should haue plenary Iustice, yet many complaints haue been made vnto Vs by diuers of Our louing Subiects, of many and great abuses dayly committed within Our Kingdomes, for that both in, and about <hi>London,</hi> and other places in Our Kingdomes, and in places beyond the Seas, diuers Counterpoizes of Our Money of Gold, commonly called Gold-weights, and Beames, and Ballances for poising of these Moneys, were made and put to sale, marked with Our Ensignes, yet many of those poizes haue been too heauie, many too light, and the Beames and Ballances haue not beene equall and iust, but were made as ill affected people required, who often times did buy and receiue by one weight, and did sell and deliuer by another, whereby Our louing Subiects were dayly deceiued to their great losse and detriment, and to the high dishonour of Vs and Our intentions in that behalfe.</p>
            <p>And whereas in matter of Our Coine there is nothing of Our more consequence next to the purenesse and weight of the Coines themselues, then that the counterpoises or weights with graines and remedies, which represent the iustnesse of our said Coines, should bee alwayes iust, and according to the true weight of the same, and that they should bee poised in an equall ballance and a iust beame. Wherefore for redresse of such abuses, too frequently vsed, and for Our owne honour, and the good of Our people, and that none may presume to counterfeit, import, make, sell, or marke with Our Royall ensignes, counterpoises or weights of Our money of Gold, or Graines, and halfe Graines in the poising thereof to bee vsed; And that the same with the beames and ballances should bee equall and iust, Wee haue taken into Our owne hands the making, assising, and issuing of the said Counterpoises or Weights with Graines and halfe Graines: And doe by this Our Royall Proclamation publish and declare, that the weights wherewith our money of Gold shall bee poised after the sixe and twentieth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next comming, shall bee made of a round and circular forme, wherein shall bee inscribed certaine markes ordeined by Vs, that they may easily bee knowne from Weights formerly vsed, which shall bee of the full and iust size according to the true Weights of the Gold Moneyes, and the Graines and halfe Graines shall be apart by themselues, to shew the remedies and abatements as they ought to bee, and none of them shall bee made with the remedies and abatements pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely taken off, (commonly called Blancke weights) and for the better effecting of this Our pleasure, Wee haue committed the care of making and assising of those Counterpoises and
<pb facs="tcp:185741:2"/>Weights to <hi>Sir Thomas Aylesbury Barronet,</hi> one of the masters of Requests vnto Vs, whom We haue commanded to haue in readinesse in the Towre of <hi>London,</hi> sufficient numbers of the said Weights, Graines and halfe Graines, with iust and equall Beames and Ballances for the vse of them, exactly and diligently made and syzed to furnish our subiects, by the sixe and twentieth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next comming, to bee issued at reasonable price.</p>
            <p>And Our will and pleasure is, that the chiefe officers in all Cities, Borroughes and townes Corporate, with all conuenient speede shall prouide one paire of the said Weights and Ballances sufficient, at the hands of the said <hi>Sir Thomas Aylesbury,</hi> or such as hee shall appoint to deliuer the same made according to the fashion aforesaid, within euery such Citie, Borrough, and towne Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, well and safely to bee kept, that such as will may haue recourse and accesse vnto them for discerning of the true Weights of Our Money of Gold, whereof receipts or paiments shalbe as occasion shall require. And We doe straigtly by these presents inhibite all our subiects and others whatsoeuer within Our Dominions after the said sixe &amp; twentieth day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> next comming, to haue or vse any other Weights of or for the Coines of Gold and remedies thereof, then onely such as shall bee made circular, and syzed and issued by the appointment of the said <hi>Sir Thomas Aylesbury.</hi> And that no person or persons of what estate, degree or condition soeuer they bee or shall be, doe at any time hereafter presume to make, cast, contriue, frame or cause to be made any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoises or weights, Graines or halfe Graines, or any Toole, Instrument, Presse, Mil, Stamps, Punchions, Counterpunchions, or any thing else whatsoeuer, for the making, casting, framing or prepairing of such Weights, or vent or import the same made, other then the said <hi>Sir Thomas Aylesbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or such as shalbe therunto appointed by Vs, vpon paine of Our high indignation &amp; displeasure, and such other paines and penalties, as by the Lawes and Statutes of this Our Realme, or by Our Prerogatiue Royall can or may bee inflicted vpon contemners of Our Proclamations and Royall Commands: And it is Our pleasure, that in receipts and payments of Our Money of Gold, none bee compelled to trye the weight thereof by other Poyses or Weights then those that shall bee made of a forme circular, as is before set foorth.</p>
            <p>And Wee doe by these presents giue power and authoritie, and expresse commandement to all Our Iudges, Iustices, &amp; to Our Attourney generall for the time being, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, Iustices of Peace, Stewards in Courts and Leetes, Headboroughs, Constables, and other Our Officers and Ministers of Iustice whatsoeuer, that they and euery of them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attend the due execution of this Our Proclamation, and vpon complaint made, proceed in Our high Court of Starrechamber, or elsewhere, against such as shall disobey or impugne the same, whereby the offenders may receiue condigne punishment according to their demerits, as they tender Our pleasure, and weale and benefit of Our Kingdomes, and will auoide the contrary at their perils.</p>
